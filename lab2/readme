This directory contains two python programs that extract information from the reuters articles located at

-Run Instructions-
KMeans
	for a smaller test sample run:
		make km_test
	for a larger sample (~3K samples  or 400sec on stdlinux):
		make km_all
	
	to use the cosine simularity just modify the command to "make km_test_cs" and "make km_all_cs"

	output showing the number of samples for each topic in each cluster and other statistics will be shown in the console.
DBSCAN
	for a smaller test sample run:
		make db_test
	for a larger sample (~3K samples or 400sec on stdlinux):
		make db_all
	
	to use the cosine simularity just modify the command to "make db_test_cs" and "make db_all_cs"

	output showing the number of samples for each topic in each cluster and other statistics will be shown in the console.
